## Base Forest mask and Fragmentation  

This application allows the user to:  

- define an area of interest
- retrieve tree cover change data from the Hansen et al., (2013) dataset.
- combine the layers to produce a forest change map, for a given canopy cover threshold
- use a fragmentation tool (Vogt & Ritter, 2017) to measure the integrity of forests   

  
this process will be performed in two steps
  
## Background info on GFC  

GFC provides global layers of information on tree cover and tree cover change since 2000, at 30m spatial resolution and consists of:

- Tree canopy cover for the year 2000 (treecover2000)
- Global forest cover gain 2000–2012 (gain)
- Year of gross forest cover loss event (lossyear)

## Background info on MSPA  

MSPA (Morphological Spatial Pattern Analysis) is a customized sequence of mathematical morphological operators targeted at the description of the geometry and connectivity of the image components. Based on geometric concepts only, this methodology can be applied at any scale and to any type of digital images in any application field.
